# What's new in Microsoft Graph

Microsoft Graph provides a unified programmability model that you can use to access data in Microsoft 365, Windows, and Enterprise Mobility + Security. This article provides information about what's new in Microsoft Graph APIs, documentation, SDKs, and more.

For more detailed API-level updates, see the [Microsoft Graph API changelog](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/changelog/).

For details about previous updates to Microsoft Graph, see [Microsoft Graph what's new history](whats-new-earlier.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Features in _preview_ status are subject to change without notice, and might not be promoted to generally available (GA) status. Don't use preview features in production apps.

## May 2025: New and generally available

### Backup storage

- [Restore sessions](/graph/api/resources/restoresessionbase) and [restore artifacts](/graph/api/resources/restoreartifactbase) that are older than one year and in a terminal state are removed.
- Use the new restore bulk addition request API for more convenient, efficient, and scalable restore solutions. This API is designed to streamline the restore process by allowing direct submission of restoration resources in a bulk request. The following resources are supported:
  - [driveRestoreArtifactsBulkAdditionRequest](/graph/api/resources/driverestoreartifactsbulkadditionrequest)
  - [mailboxRestoreArtifactsBulkAdditionRequest](/graph/api/resources/mailboxrestoreartifactsbulkadditionrequest)
  - [siteRestoreArtifactsBulkAdditionRequest](/graph/api/resources/siterestoreartifactsbulkadditionrequest)

### Calendars
