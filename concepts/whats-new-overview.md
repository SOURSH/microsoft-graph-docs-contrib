## March 2025: New and generally available

### Applications

Updated the Microsoft Entra built-in role required to [perform a new bulk upload](/graph/api/synchronization-synchronizationjob-post-bulkupload). Going forward, admin users can use the User Administrator role instead of the Global Administrator role to invoke this API.

### Microsoft Graph connector

The management of Microsoft Graph connectors in the Microsoft Teams admin center will be deprecated on April 14, 2025. Going forward, you can manage Microsoft Graph connectors from the **Search & intelligence** section in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoftsearch/manage-connector).

The limit per call record changed from 10 requests to 40 requests per 20 seconds for all pages, and the limit for list call records changed from 15 requests to 40 requests per 20 seconds for all pages.

### Teamwork and communications | Messaging

Going forward, admin users can use the User Administrator role instead of the Global Administrator role to invoke this API.

### Device and app management | Cloud PC

- Use the call delegation APIs in Microsoft Graph to query and manage delegates and delegators for a user. A delegator grants a delegate the ability to perform actions like making calls or managing settings on their behalf, and the delegate undertakes these tasks.
