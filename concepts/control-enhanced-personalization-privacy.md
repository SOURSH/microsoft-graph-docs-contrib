# M365 Copilot's Use of the Enhanced Personalization Control

M365 Copilot can become personalised to each user, aiding them in their day-to-day tasks by understanding their work knowledge on an individual level. We enable tenant administrators such as the Global Admininstrator role, and users through requests to their tenant administrators to manage this through the Enhanced Personalization control. By the end of this overview you will understand how M365 Copilot achieves greater personalization through various features when this is enabled, how your privacy is maintained, and how to control both feature use & overall control of Enhanced Personalization for M365 Copilot.

## Learn what uses the Enhanced Personalization Control

### Communications Recaps

Is a personal communication memory bank that enables M365 Copilot to have access to all the knowledge trapped in your day-to-day communications. M365 Copilot captures these recaps once every 24 hours and groups them by person who communicated them. M365 Copilot search, creation of content, and summarisation are then further personalised using these recaps to provide more relevant results just for you. For examples and details see the Microsoft Learn article [here](/concepts/communications-recaps-details.md).
