# How to use redirect files

<!-- cSpell:ignore openpublishing -->

- Files are named by month and year, with the pattern being `.openpublishing.redirection.<year>-<month>.json`.
  - **Don't** add new redirects to a file that doesn't match the current month/year. If a file doesn't exist for the current month/year and you need to add a redirect, create a new file using the naming pattern.
  - Files are deleted after a year *based on the file name*.
