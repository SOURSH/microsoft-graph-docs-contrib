## Response

If successful, this action returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [policyTenantScope](../resources/policytenantscope.md) objects in the response body. Each object represents a set of locations and activities governed by a common set of policy actions and execution mode, along with the user/group bindings for that specific policy configuration.

## Example

### Request

The following example computes the tenant-wide protection scope for text uploads, interested in a specific domain, pivoting the results by location.

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/security/dataSecurityAndGovernance/protectionScopes/compute
Content-type: application/json

{
  "activities": "uploadText",
  "locations": [
    {
      "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.policyLocationDomain",
      "value": "public.contoso.com"
    }
  ],
  "pivotOn": "location",
  "deviceMetadata": {
    "deviceType": "managed",
    "operatingSystemSpecifications": {
       "operatingSystemPlatform": "Windows",
       "operatingSystemVersion": "10.0.19045"
    }
  },
  "integratedAppMetadata": {
      "name": "Contoso Service Monitor",
      "version": "2.0.1"
  }
}
```

### Response

The following example shows the response. It indicates that for uploads to `public.contoso.com`, there's a policy applicable to "All" users (tenant scope) that requires inline evaluation and triggers a browser restriction.
