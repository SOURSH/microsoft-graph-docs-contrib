### aiInteraction

Subscriptions on Copilot AI interactions require a valid Copilot license that includes the following Copilot service plan:

* **Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat**: 3f30311c-6b1e-48a4-ab79-725b469da960

For subscriptions that target Copilot AI interactions that a particular user is part of, the user in the resource path must have the previous service plans assigned to them in a valid state.

For subscriptions that target Copilot AI interactions for the entire tenant, the tenant must have valid licenses provisioned that include all previous Copilot service plans.
