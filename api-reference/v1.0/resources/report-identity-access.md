# Identity and access reports API overview

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

With Microsoft Graph, you can programmatically accesss identity and access reports to monitor and troubleshoot all activities in your tenant. In addition, you can analyze these logs with Azure Monitor logs and Log Analytics, or stream to third-party SIEM tools for further investigations.

The availability of all Microsoft Entra identity and access reports is governed by the [Microsoft Entra data retention policies](/entra/identity/monitoring-health/reference-reports-data-retention#how-long-does-azure-ad-store-the-data).

## Available reports

### Application activity reports

#### AD FS application activity

The AD FS application activity report provides information about how a relying party is configured with Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), its aggregated usage, and whether the relying party configuration can be migrated to Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, see the [relyingPartyDetailedSummary](/graph/api/resources/applicationsigninsummary) resource.

#### Authentication methods registration and usage activity

Authentication methods activity reports provides information on the registration and usage of [authentication methods](../resources/authenticationmethods-overview.md) in your tenant. For example, how many users are registered for an authentication method, how any are capable for MFA or SSPR, and so on. You can determine which authentication methods are more successful for your organization, what types of errors end users are running into, and what campaign you need to run to help your end users adopt the use of SSPR and MFA.

For more information, see [authentication method usage APIs](../resources/authenticationmethods-usage-insights-overview.md).

### Microsoft Entra audit logs

Audit logs are available for sign-ins, activities in the directory, and provisioning. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra audit logs](../resources/azure-ad-auditlog-overview.md).
